## Pre-Race
Six weeks before the race, I was limping after a seven-mile run.  When I got checked out, the doctor said I had posterior tibial tendonitis; I was not to run for three weeks.  I texted Coach because every time I’m injured it feels like a failure and I didn’t want to call.   I told him I couldn’t do the race.  He called me almost every day that week, talking me back into the race and encouraging me to do just the swim and the bike.  I didn’t realize I could turn the chip in and skip the run.  Sure, there wouldn’t be a medal, but that wasn’t why I wanted to do this.  He said he’d turn me into a fish and boy did he.  He is really good at building up my confidence and encouraging without pushing too hard.  In the first eight days I swam thirteen thousand yards.  Then I added back in bike rides.  After the three weeks I added in slow 10-15 minute runs.  I didn’t do anything more than that before the race because it was taper time!

The last week before the race I was having a terrible time sleeping.  I’ve never had trouble falling asleep, in fact, sometimes I’ll fall asleep at 8:30 pm on stressful or heavy training days.  I still didn’t have trouble falling asleep, but I would wake up between 1 am and 3 am having trouble falling back to sleep.  After a few hours I would take some Nyquil and go back to sleep.  By the end of the week, I slept with Nyquil by my bed.  When I’m sick I like falling asleep to Nyquil and have a hard time giving it up; I was worried this would be a similar situation.  The night we arrived in Chattanooga I had forgotten my Nyquil.  We didn’t have the kids, I just laid awake for hours trying not to worry about how tired I would be.  The next day we went to the store to get oatmeal, Ziplocs, and Nyquil.  I took Nyquil around 7:30 pm instead of waking up to take some since my alarm was set for 4:30 am.  Then I packed my snacks, using Ziplocs instead of the Stinger bags because they didn’t fit in my shirt pocket as well as they do in my jersey pocket.  I made a PB&J, filled up all my waters (without nutrition), shaved, and laid down to go to sleep.    

## Race Morning
My alarm went off and I was ready to move.  Thanks to my Nyqil and early bedtime I felt more rested than the day before.  I got dressed and started prepping for the race.  I made a package of oatmeal, chai tea, and mixed OSMO in my water bottles.  After my first package of oatmeal I was still hungry, so I made a second.  Stacey and I had planned to meet at transition at 5:30 am and my walk I guessed would take 10 minutes.  I noticed my right foot had a little pain from all the walking yesterday.  It was in a different spot as my tendonitis from several weeks back, but I was worried about that.  

We pumped our tires and placed our transition items down.  Both she and I had bikes missing next to us but when she spread out and official told her to move back so I didn’t try.  Her bike looked at my bike on the racks, we were super close!  We lined up for the buses to take us to transition and it was still dark outside.  Stacey had some sandals to put in her morning bag, but I didn’t get any.  Next time for this race I should because the ground hurt my feet.  The guy in front of us in line had a kit with Try Bike Shop on his back so we talked to him and his wife for a bit on the bus ride.  Stacey braded my hair since I cannot do it myself.  

## Swim
I ate my banana and made myself go to the porta potties before we lined up for the swim.  While we were lining up I was so thirsty, next time bring a full throw away bottle of water!  I wanted to seed myself at 30-35 minutes, but Stacey wanted to stay with me so we did 36-40 minutes.  This was a popular seed group.  Once the pro’s started it took about 30 minutes for us to get up to the docks.  

There were several people with signs at the docks.  My favorite was “Worst Parade EVER!!!” There was also one saying, “All this for half a tattoo!”

The start was weird, we just kept moving and when we got to the end of the docks we had to jump or sit down and slide into the water.  Theoretically, everyone got to the end of the dock and kept moving on into the water, but many people were procrastinating, the announcer had to keep telling them to go.  I jumped in, excited!  I was ready, or so I thought.  I came back up holding my goggles on and it was chaos!!!  There was an older man breathing so heavy he sounded like he was dying.  I saw way too many feet hanging down in front of me because they were back stroking, if I can call it that.  I panicked and couldn’t catch my breath for about 5 seconds.  I thought, “Screw Coach and his stupid open water race, this sucks!”  Then I saw my first buoy and turned, super excited.  A kayak blocked me, I lifted my head out of the water.  He kept yelling, “You are off course, go back.”  It took two tries for me to understand what he was saying.  I looked back and saw the rest of them still swimming in a straight line.  I kept thinking, “ugh, can I get a restart??”  While I was swimming back, I got stuck behind a kayak and a boat who were together helping a guy out of the water.  I pushed them apart (thinking back, that was probably not a good Samaritan thing to do, but I was not sure what to do then.)  

After about 5 minutes (a good warmup time since we weren’t allowed to warmup in the water before the start of the race) I found my pacing and my confidence.  I also found so many bubbles to draft.  The problem with these bubbles was that I was faster and every time I found some to draft, I was accidentally grabbing their feet and had to go around them.  I’m not used to needing to pass someone! 

I practiced sighting once at Dallas Landing prior to the race, but I didn’t do it like I practiced.  Note to self:  do that more often!  Instead I kept my bilateral breathing and when I looked right I made sure the buoys were there.  This was not the best idea because I found myself to the right of a red buoy and couldn’t get to the other side of it because there were two people I was passing also to my left.  I had heard the announcer saying to stay to the left of the red buoys, I started fretting about a DNF for making that mistake.  

I didn’t know how to know when I was at the end, but then I saw people perpendicular to me, I turned and sprinted like my last 25 yards at the pool.  Then people were helping me out of the water and I was wishing I had more swim to go.

I walked to the wetsuit strippers.  They had me sit to remove the wetsuit and my shorts didn’t come off.  Then I was off up a long hill to transition (walking instead of running).  

## T1
 Stacey had beat me out of the swim by 16 seconds.  I saw her and yelled, “Stacey, you beat me out of the water!!!”  I was surprised, but very excited for her.  There were still so many bikes racked which made me feel good.  I ate half a PBJ and drank some clean water with OSMO.  Then I read my transition list and got everything ready.  I did something I scold my children for doing, I grabbed some chamois cream and shoved my hand down my shorts in public.  I walked my bike to the mount line and started the really nice bike ride.  My time was 7:50, but it didn’t seem that long.  The swim exit was ¼ mile from transition though.

## Bike
I clipped into my bike just after the mount line and checked my heartrate.  Despite walking my bike, I was at 170 bpm and the plan was 135 bpm.  I assumed it was adrenaline and decided to make sure my breathing wasn’t labored at all as my test instead.

I was passed by so many people on the bike.  Luckily, that is not discouraging, instead I kept thinking, I’m faster than you on the swim!  This bike ride is awesome, I’d love to do it more.  I passed silos, cows, fields, and there were beautiful mountains in the background.  

After 2 miles a man looking like a football coach was yelling at us to cheer us on during the race.  He kept yelling, “Pedal defense.  Push it.”  He was really into it, and that cracked me up.  At mile 8 or so, one of the pro guys was already coming back from his loop with a police escort.  It wasn’t until mile 10 that we saw the rest of them!  

The two main things I thought about early on during the bike ride were DNF’ing due to the swim buoy and the match metaphor Stacey and Coach used.  The metaphor goes: “every athlete comes equipped with a box of matches.  You do not know how many you have.  Each time you push it, you burn a match.  Don’t run out!”  I only passed people on the hills or these two guys on separate occasions who were super wobbly and scary to be behind.  

On the first little hill I dropped my chain.  I pulled over and it took me a couple minutes to get it working right and then there were groups of bikes (definitely drafting) where I didn’t feel confident jumping out in the middle of the hill.  Once I did, I wobbled and took off at a snail pace because I was on a hill.  As per my norm, I was covered in grease on my hands, leg, and my wrist band.  I’m really surprised my bike photos don’t show grease all over my face!  I decided to stay in my big ring the rest of the ride.  Even though I was in my big ring, I still passed people on every hill!  Way to go road bike!

I put my snacks in Ziplocs because they didn’t fit in my kit in their packaging, but it also was much easier for me to open and eat on the ride.  I ate every hour and tried to drink every 15 minutes.  I have a favorite water bottle, a big one for the back, and one that is tight in the cage and annoying to get out.  My favorite one was recommended by someone because it has a loop to grab and I’ve had it for a long time.  The big one on the back is easy to get out and put back so it’s fine.  I can’t find the same loopy bottle anymore, so I bought another small one.  It’s a little tight to get out of my cage and doesn’t have a loop so I’m always worried I’d drop it.  I got cheered on by a traffic cop for putting my favorite bottle in my mouth, pulled out the sucky water bottle, then putting it in the closer cage and putting my favorite bottle in the further cage.  Later I was holding my big bottle and went over a bridge.  It bounced out of my hands and I pulled over to get it.  Luckily, it was not on a hill.  

At about half way most people who were going to pass me had already passed me.  There were some people where we went back and forth passing each other.  One guy came up and said “left”, then said, “maybe not…” I cheered him on and told him to pass me.  

I tried to stay in aero for most of the ride, but I did need to sit up to stretch my back some.  I love my saddle and it only bothered my inner thighs a bit, but I can live with that kind of pain.  While riding in the GA part I was not alone, but we were pretty spaced out and I was looking down more.  When I noticed a family close to the sidewalk, I looked up.  The woman was holding a sign saying, “Free BEER!” and an open beer.  I caught her eyes and we laughed. 

My third and final stop on the bike ride happened on purpose.  At mile 45 I pulled over to grab a water bottle since my three were all gone and filled up my favorite bottle and put it back in the front cage.  It was delicious cold water.  I stopped to do this because I wasn’t sure if I would fall over while pouring or make the trash cutoff.  

At mile fifty I was with a group and we were definitely too close.  I cheered for mile fifty and got some laughs, but one guy pouted.  I still felt really good because I didn’t push it at all earlier in the ride.  With fifteen miles left I let myself push a little harder and when I got to the unmount section, my legs still felt really good.  I was very sad the bike ride was over I really wanted another loop.  It was also a little sad when I saw all the bikes that were racked.  My bike time was 3:46 which gave me a 14.8 mph average.  My watch auto pauses, excluding the stops my moving time averaged 15.2 mph, my max speed was 35.2 mph and an elevation gain of 2,218 ft.  

## T2
I drank more water with OSMO in it, read my notes and headed out to the last part of the race and my biggest worry. I did have to sit down to put my ankle corset (aka brace) to help stabilize my foot and hopefully prevent tendonitis from coming back.  All that took 6:05.

## Run
Can I call what I do running?  I’ve heard a few people complain about running after biking, but I enjoy it.  I started out with a faster than normal pace and slowed it down.  The first 2 miles are hills, then there are more hills, and finally more hills making the elevation gain for the total run around 800 ft.  I hated the run starting at mile 2.   I couldn’t bring my heartrate down to where it was supposed to be, it was hot, it was too hilly, whine whine, whine.  During my first loop, Stacey passed me doing her second loop.  I cheered her on and told her to get a PR.  We high fived when she turned around.  Seeing Stacey helped improve my mood about running.  

At mile 6 I was feeling isolated, despite there being so many people around me.  Instead of focusing on the second loop I talked to everyone I could.  My favorite question to ask was would you rather run this hill or bike it?  Sometimes I’d tell people I’d race them to the next aid station.  There were three people who were the most memorable.  A guy from New Orleans who was complaining about these hills.  He said he’s used to below sea level and he was having altitude sickness.  I didn’t think that was possible where we were, but I bit my tongue.  A man from Adairsville, GA who was also complaining about the hills.  I gave him a fist bump and told him to pass me in a few minutes.  A woman from Chicago.  She DNF’ed her first and last full IronMan at Louiville, KY.  It was during a bad storm and it took her eight hours to finish the bike, but there was terrible debris blowing all over the course.  

I feel like my nutrition on the course was pretty good, but needed a small change.  I ate honey stinger chews twice during the run.  I carried a few bags of two scoops of OSMO and added them to water every hour.  The only thing I think I should have done differently was added OSMO at mile 1 and start off with it.  I felt immediately better when I added it after the first hour.  

I read that mile nine hurts in half marathons.  Starting at mile 2 I ran/walked, and I was prepared for mile nine, but I felt fine.  It didn’t suck until mile ten.  I ate a stinger waffle to cheer me up and cheered everyone who passed me probably with crumbs falling everywhere.  At mile ten my hips started hurting a little and I realized my socks were soaking wet from all the ice the volunteers kept putting down my shirt and the sponges on my head.  By mile 11 my hips hurt a lot.  

I sang a lot to keep busy.  Several times I found myself singing Highly Suspect’s “Lydia” because I had little baggies of white “stuff”.  “What’s worse is all the coke, the ice that numbs my throat, if only for the night…” And then I would giggle at my corny joke.  I also sang a lot of Sublime; chill songs for not a chill day.

There were some good posters to keep me going.  “I don’t do triathlons, I do triathletes.”  Notice the plural!  “Smile if you peed on your bike today!”  I normally have a teeny tiny bladder, but I never thought about using the bathroom until after I was done.  “Don’t Stop, Don’t Stop!  That’s what she said”  Yes, I’m a terrible person and crude humor cracks me up.

I ran down the chute to finish the run and Stacey was there.  I yelled “STACEY” at the top of my lungs, picked up my pace and gave her a high five.  Then at the other side, my husband was there videoing me.  I was all smiles and no tears, I couldn’t believe I did it!  I decided before the race I wasn’t going to quit, the race officials were going to have to make me quit instead.  I expected to be pulled off the run course, but I met every cutoff and it was amazing (and terrible, and awesome).  My run (walk) was 3:00:49!

## Post-Race
I found out that being on the wrong side of the red buoy did not make me DNF!  That along with the fact that I could eat real food was exciting.  The real food they offered sucked.  It was cheap pizza, but I scarfed two pieces down and looked forward to some better food later.

After the race, my hips hurt a bunch which lasted 2 days.  The outside of my left foot hurt and clicked every time I walked without shoes (this was not the foot with tendonitis).  This continued hurting for a week.  My right calf hurt for the evening – the same one that had a calf tear.  My right ankle hurt, but the same amount that it hurt from walking the day before.  I got a finger length raspberry on my back from the shorts rubbing against my skin.  I didn’t get a single blister on my feet despite the wet socks!  

The next day I had my first glass of wine since February.  Actually, that’s a lie, I had two glasses at a wedding, but those don’t count because it was a special occasion.  I also had my first dessert since February.  I took four or five bites and it was delicious, but it hurt my stomach so that’s it for the sugar I’ve had.  

The next weekend I started my period a full week early, probably from the physical stress.  Hurray for a three-week cycle :-(

## Future Thoughts
Would I do another one of these races?  Heck yea!  This year?  Depends on my budget, but definitely next year!  In three falls my baby will be in kindergarten and I’ll be 40 in four years.  That is a great goal for a full distance race.
